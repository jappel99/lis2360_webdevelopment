                <h2><i>What is Virtual Reality</i></h2>
                <p> Virtual reality (VR) is new and constantly changing technology.VR uses goggles to completly emmurse its user in a whole new world. First, the techonolgy was produced for the entertainment of customers. Most of the early development of VR was done by individuals interested by the theoretical technology. Then major video game companies such like Nintendo and Sega made VR avaiable by everyone.</p>
                <p>Virtual reality has come a long way since its original introduction in the mid 90's. Since its introduction there have been massive improvements on the technology. VR can now put its users in a completly unique universe. The best part about this new technology is that we are just getting started. Full online video games have started being produced with a whole world for the user to explore. VR has even influenced Hollywood, there are more and more VR based movies being released. Most notably "Ready Player One", this film grossed over 500 million at the box office and it showed the potential of VR to the entire world.</p>
               
                <p> Virtual Reality started off as another form of entertainment but now it is being used for more that just that. VR is making leaps and bounds in the medical field. VR has allowed doctors to be able to practice different surguries in a simulated environment. This <q>removes the need for invasive procdures or surgery</q>. This technology saves lives and allows doctors to perfect their craft in an environemnt that has no repercussoions.  </p>
               
                <p>The military has also taken advantages of VR. The military has been using this new techonolgy to simulate harmful environments. The military has used VR to place its soliders in a training exercise without the risk of life. These include flight, battle, and vehicle simulation. VR may not be able to perfectly recreate the real world, but it allows individuals to prepare for real battle.  </p>
